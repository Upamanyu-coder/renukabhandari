## 🚀 Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```
2.  **Ensure Assets are Present:** Make sure all image files (`img.png`, `facebook-icon.png`, etc.) and the `styles.css` file are in the same directory as `index.html`, or update the paths in `index.html` accordingly.
3.  **Open in Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

No special build steps or server-side requirements are needed as this is a static HTML and CSS website.

## ✏️ Customization

*   **Text Content:** Modify the headings, paragraphs, and names directly in `index.html`.

    *   Update the `href` attributes in the `<a>` tags to point to the correct social media profiles.
*   **Email Contact:**
